# Quantum Infodynamics
## Theory of Motion in Real Space

This repository contains the programs and any other materials related to Quantum Infodynamics.

* dynamics [MAIN]--- Tools for simulating any [info]dynamical system on both the quantum and classical level

* harmonic-oscillator [OBSOLETE] --- Sample programs simulating the ubiquitous harmonic oscillator

For more information see the project's website at http://quantuminfodynamics.com

### Pre-requisites for using tools in "dynamics" directory

* Python 3.5.2

* Nupy >= 1.11.3

* Scipy >= 0.18.1

* Matplotlib >= 1.5.3

* PyFFTW >= 0.10.4 (but the slower scipy.fftpack and even numpy.fft can also be used)
